# Provision OCP Hub on AWS

In this section you will provision an OpenShift cluster on AWS that will function as the ACM Hub. From there, you will provision all other clusters.

## Prereqs
* AWS account with proper permissions
* DNS configured on AWS
* Pull secret from try.openshift.com
* Get the latest OCP installer and CLI tools.

1. Create an install config. Give it an appropriate name, like `<engineer>-hub.<engineer>.sysdeseng.com`.

```
./openshift-install create install-config --dir=acm-hub
```

2. Modify the worker node size to reflect the following change.

```
compute:
- hyperthreading: Enabled
  platform:
    aws:
      type:
        m4.2xlarge
  replicas: 3
```

3. Provision the cluster.

```
./openshift-install create cluster --dir=acm-hub
```

4. Note the OCP credentials: kubeconfig, kubeadmin user and password

5. Log into the OpenShift cluster via CLI and browse around.

6. Explore the clusters, specifically existing namespaces.
